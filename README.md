#DeepEstate: AI-Powered Real Estate Price Prediction

This project implements an intelligent multi-modal deep learning framework for real estate analysis and price prediction using a dataset from Bengaluru, India.
Built and experimented entirely in Google Colab using Python, Streamlit, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and pyngrok for deployment.
The system predicts sale prices for residential properties including Apartments and Villas based on features like area, bedrooms, age, locality, and furnishing.
Provides a web-based interactive Streamlit app for easy user input and real-time price estimation.
Includes data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and deployment steps.
Hosted with tunneling services like ngrok to provide a live demo accessible online.

Features
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Model based on structured tabular data.
Real-time price prediction via an interactive Streamlit interface.
Easily extendable for multi-modal data and larger datasets.
Demonstrates integration of ML workflow with practical deployment on cloud.

Usage
Run the app using Streamlit interface through Google Colab.
Input property details and get instant estimated sale price.
The model and app can be modified or expanded for other cities or property types.
